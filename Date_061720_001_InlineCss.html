		<p>For inline CSS, we add style attribute to the element tag we want to style and then put in all the styling information separated between semi-colons.</p>
		<hr>
		<h1>This is written without any css applied to h1 tag !</h1>
		<h1 style="color:green;font-size:200%">This is written within styled h1 tag !</h1>
		<h1 style="color:red;font-size:150%">This is written within styled h1 tag !</h1>
		<h1 style="color:blue;font-size:100%">This is written within styled h1 tag !</h1>
		<h1 style="color:pink;font-size:50%">This is written within styled h1 tag !</h1>
		
		<p>NOTE: With internal CSS  disadvantage is that, if we want to remove all styling from a web page, we can simply do that by removing all code from within the style tag in the head section. But if we had used inline css, then it becomes extremely difficult to remove/diffuse the styling of all elements because then styling at each individual element should be removed.</p>
